# Infrastructure as Code - Introduction

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

## Key Concepts

### What is Infrastructure as Code?

IaC treats infrastructure configuration as software code, enabling:

- **Version Control**: Track changes to infrastructure over time
- **Reproducibility**: Create identical environments consistently
- **Automation**: Deploy infrastructure without manual intervention
- **Documentation**: Infrastructure becomes self-documenting

### Benefits of IaC

- **Consistency**: Eliminates configuration drift
- **Speed**: Rapid provisioning and scaling
- **Cost Management**: Better resource optimization
- **Risk Reduction**: Tested, predictable deployments

## IaC Tools Comparison

| Tool | Type | Language | Cloud Support |
|------|------|----------|---------------|
| Terraform | Declarative | HCL | Multi-cloud |
| CloudFormation | Declarative | JSON/YAML | AWS only |
| Pulumi | Imperative | Multiple | Multi-cloud |
| Ansible | Imperative | YAML | Multi-cloud |
